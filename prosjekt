It should contain the following sections and suggested content (as a
minimum):

1. Introduction
• Brief introduction of robot type, based on a literature search
• Description of task to perform, and requirements
• An overview of your approach to the problem
2. Design Process
• What design iterations have you gone through?
• Who worked on what, and when?
• What problems did you encounter, and how did you solve them?
3. Implementation
• Describe the final implementation of your robotic system
• Include figures with images/drawings etc.
• Include your solutions for kinematics, motion planning etc.
• Be brief, include support material in appendices, if need be
• Use the structure from the requirements section
4. Experiments
• What testing have you performed of the virtual-physical robot (or subsystems)
• How well have you been able to perform the goal task?
• Use the structure from the requirements section
5. Conclusion
• Briefly conclude on the work done
• Make sure you have complied with all the requirements!
References
• Here you should put a numbered list of references to all sources you have used in
the report, using IEEE referencing style
